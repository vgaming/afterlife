Each two turns your units are copied to enemy part of the map.

These copies get stronger every turn. Survive enemy waves longer than your opponent.

If you enable ''Control copies'' setting, then old copies get weaker each wave (to avoid defensive strategy). If they have less than 3 HP, they disappear.
