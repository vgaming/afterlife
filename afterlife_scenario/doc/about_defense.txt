Each two turns your units are copied to enemy part of the map.

These copies get stronger every turn. Survive enemy waves longer than your opponent.

Old copies get 50% weaker each wave if they are controlled by human (to avoid stacking them up). If they have less than 4 max_hitpoints, they are killed and enemy gets 6 gold.
