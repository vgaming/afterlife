Afterlife is a map with elements of Human-vs-Human and Survival games.

Each two turns, all your units are copied to enemy part of the map to be controlled by AI.
Players will have to fight with these copies, which get stronger every turn.

Note: this map has similarities with ''Sacrifice survival'', but I hope it is more balanced.
