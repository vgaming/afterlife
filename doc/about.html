Afterlife is a map with elements of Human-vs-Human and Survival games.

Each turn, all your units are copied to enemy part of the map to be controlled by AI.
Players will have to fight with these copies, which get stronger every turn.

Note: this map has similarities with ''Sacrifice survival'', but I hope this map is more balanced.
