<b>Scroll rules</b>
The map scrolls down before each wave. Either to a distance of 5, or lower, if you have units standing in the way.

Copy strength depends on the distance you traveled at last turn: <b>distance * 20%</b>

Scroll as fast as you can, but not too fast so that enemy copies won't kill you.
